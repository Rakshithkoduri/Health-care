# Health Care Assistant - Disease Prediction System

## Overview
Health Care Assistant is a Flask-based web application that predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system utilizes machine learning models (SVM and Decision Tree) to analyze symptoms entered via text or voice input and provides predictions along with recommended doctors and medications.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Input Symptom Analysis
- **Text Input**: Users can type their symptoms in natural language
- **Voice Input**: Voice-to-text functionality for hands-free symptom entry
- **Symptom Selection**: Interactive interface for selecting symptoms from a predefined list

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction
- **Dual Model Architecture**: 
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
  - Decision Tree classifier
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from both models for improved accuracy
- **Probability Scores**: Provides confidence levels for each prediction

### 3. Comprehensive Health Information
- **Disease Details**: Description of predicted conditions
- **Doctor Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate medical specialists
- **Medication Guidance**: Provides common treatment options (for informational purposes only)

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- Responsive web design works on desktop and mobile
- Intuitive symptom selection process
- Clean, accessible presentation of results

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (SVM and Decision Tree implementations)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Basic text processing for symptom interpretation
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful design for frontend-backend communication

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Semantic markup with responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and voice recognition
- **Bootstrap**: UI components and layout framework

### Data
- **Custom Dataset**: Curated collection of symptoms-disease mappings
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Symptom normalization
  - Feature encoding
  - Train-test splitting (80-20 ratio)
- **Model Training**: 
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Cross-validation
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall metrics)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-care-assistant.git
   cd health-care-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Dataset Information

The custom dataset includes:
- 200+ diseases
- 400+ associated symptoms
- Doctor specialties mapping
- Common medications information

Data was collected from reputable medical sources and preprocessed to ensure quality predictions.

## Model Performance

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SVM            | 92.3%    | 91.8%     | 90.5%  | 91.1%    |
| Decision Tree  | 89.7%    | 88.2%     | 87.9%  | 88.0%    |
| Combined       | 93.1%    | 92.5%     | 91.8%  | 92.1%    |

## Limitations

1. **Informational Purpose Only**: Not a substitute for professional medical advice
2. **Symptom Complexity**: May struggle with rare or complex symptom combinations
3. **Data Limitations**: Coverage depends on the training dataset completeness

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems
- Multi-language support
- Mobile application development
- Enhanced NLP for better symptom understanding
- Additional machine learning models (Neural Networks, Random Forest)
